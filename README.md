# Implement Detection Networks - RCNN and YOLO

## Overview

This project focuses on object detection and implementing algorithms from scratch. The goal is to implement and train RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) and YOLO (You Only Look Once) models on a dataset of your choice. By the end of this project, you will:

- Implement bounding box detection using RCNN and YOLO.
- Train and evaluate detection models.
- Perform real-time object detection using a webcam.

## Dataset

You can use any dataset available online for object detection. Here are some recommended resources:

  Feel free to choose any dataset that includes bounding box annotations.

## Tasks

1. **Implement Bounding Box Detection**  
   - Implement a bounding box detection program using:
     - One model from the RCNN family (e.g., RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN).
     - One model from the YOLO family (e.g., YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5).
   - Training must be demonstrated in your Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Real-Time Detection**  
   - Load your trained model and perform real-time bounding box detection using your webcam.
   - Record a video of the real-time detection and include it in your submission.

## Steps for Implementation

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Download a dataset with bounding box annotations.
- Preprocess the dataset for training (e.g., resize images, normalize data).

### 2. Model Implementation
- Implement RCNN and YOLO models using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Darknet.
- Train the models on the dataset (ensure training is shown in the Jupyter Notebook).

### 3. Real-Time Detection
- Load the trained model and perform real-time detection using your webcam.
- Record the detection process and save it as a video.
